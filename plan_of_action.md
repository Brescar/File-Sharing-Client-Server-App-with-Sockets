# Plan of action

## Authentication

Hold set of credentials in CSV/JSON/whatever kind of file as a workaround.
Users are not able to create an account, but only to log in.

## File sharing

Each user will have their own user resource directory, in which the file contents will be held.

## Notifications

Topic-based implementation for notification system on log in/log out of users and adding/modifying/removing files from user directory.


## Downloads

Client downloads the **whole** file to their own directory, including metadata and all.
